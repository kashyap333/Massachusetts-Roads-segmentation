# Massachusetts-Roads-segmentation

## Context
Road Segmentation from Aerial Imagery is a challenging task. Obstruction from nearby trees, shadows of adjacent buildings, varying texture and color of roads, road class imbalance (due to relatively few road image pixels) are among other challenges that hinder present day models in segmenting sharp road boundaries that extend from one end of the image to the other. High-quality aerial imagery datasets facilitate comparisons of existing methods and lead to increased interest in aerial imagery applications in the machine learning and computer vision communities.

## Content
The Massachusetts Roads Dataset consists of 1171 aerial images of the state of Massachusetts. Each image is 1500Ã—1500 pixels in size, covering an area of 2.25 square kilometers. We randomly split the data into a training set of 1108 images, a validation set of 14 images and a test set of 49 images. The dataset covers a wide variety of urban, suburban, and rural regions and covers an area of over 2600 square kilometers. The test set alone covers over 110 square kilometers. The target maps were generated by rasterizing road centerlines obtained from the OpenStreetMap project. A line thickness of 7 pixels and no smoothing was used in generating the labels. All imagery is rescaled to a resolution of 1 pixel per square meter.
